# bybit-trade-data-backtest-module
 backtest module that uses bybit trade data instead of candles


Change only folder paths in data_pull.py and merge_trade_files.py then use update_tick_data.py

you also need to create <b>price_data</b> and <b>data</b> folder in in the same folder as scripts in order for them to work properly
